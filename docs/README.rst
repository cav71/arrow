# Apache Arrow Documentation

## Prerequisites

The documentation build process uses [Doxygen][1] and [Sphinx][2] along with a
few extensions.

If you're using Conda, the required software can be installed in a single line:

```
conda install -c conda-forge --file ci/conda_env_sphinx.yml
```

Otherwise, you'll first need to install [Doxygen][1] yourself (for example from
your distribution's official repositories, if using Linux).  Then you can
install the Python-based requirements with the following command:

```
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
```

## Building

These two steps are mandatory and must be executed in order.

1. Process the C++ API using Doxygen

```shell
pushd cpp/apidoc
doxygen
popd
```

2. Build the complete documentation using Sphinx


```shell
pushd docs
make html
popd
```

After these steps are completed, the documentation is rendered in HTML format
in `docs/_build/html`.  In particular, you can point your browser at
`docs/_build/html/index.html` to read the docs and review any changes you made.

## Building using docker compose

The ci folder in the main arrow folder contains the docker compose file docker-compose.yml, in 
order to build the documentations:

```
docker-compose build cpp 
docker-compose build python 
docker-compose run docs 
```

The final output is stored under: site/asf-site/docs/latest
